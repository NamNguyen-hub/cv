	abstract = {Early in the design process, there is often mixed epistemic model uncertainty and aleatory parameter uncertainty. Later in the design process, the results of high-fidelity simulations or experiments will reduce epistemic model uncertainty and may trigger a redesign process. Redesign is undesirable because it is associated with costs and delays; however, it is also an opportunity to correct a dangerous design or possibly improve design performance. In this study, we propose a margin-based design/redesign method where the design is optimized deterministically, but the margins are selected probabilistically. The final design is an epistemic random variable (i.e., it is unknown at the initial design stage) and the margins are optimized to control the epistemic uncertainty in the final design, design performance, and probability of failure. The method allows for the tradeoff between expected final design performance and probability of redesign while ensuring reliability with respect to mixed uncertainties. The method is demonstrated on a simple bar problem and then on an engine design problem. The examples are used to investigate the dilemma of whether to start with a higher margin and redesign if the test later in the design process reveals the design to be too conservative, or to start with a lower margin and redesign if the test reveals the design to be unsafe. In the examples in this study, it is found that this decision is related to the variance of the uncertainty in the high-fidelity model relative to the variance of the uncertainty in the low-fidelity model.},

	abstract = {Space vehicle design is a complex process involving numerous disciplines such as aerodynamics, structure, propulsion and trajectory. These disciplines are tightly coupled and may involve antagonistic objectives that require the use of specific methodologies in order to assess trade-offs between the disciplines and to obtain the global optimal configuration. Generally, there are two ways to handle the system design. On the one hand, the design may be considered from a disciplinary point of view (a.k.a. Disciplinary Design Optimization): the designer of each discipline has to design its subsystem (e.g. engine) taking the interactions between its discipline and the others (interdisciplinary couplings) into account. On the other hand, the design may also be considered as a whole: the design team addresses the global architecture of the space vehicle, taking all the disciplinary design variables and constraints into account at the same time. This methodology is known as Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) and requires specific mathematical tools to handle the interdisciplinary coupling consistency.},

	title = {Safety-margin-based design and redesign considering mixed epistemic model uncertainty and aleatory parameter uncertainty},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08978},
	abstract = {At the initial design stage engineers often rely on low-fidelity models that have high epistemic uncertainty. Traditional safety-margin-based deterministic design resorts to testing (e.g. prototype experiment, evaluation of high-fidelity simulation, etc.) to reduce epistemic uncertainty and achieve targeted levels of safety. Testing is used to calibrate models and prescribe redesign when tests are not passed. After calibration, reduced epistemic model uncertainty can be leveraged through redesign to restore safety or improve design performance; however, redesign may be associated with substantial costs or delays. In this paper, a methodology is described for optimizing the safety-margin-based design, testing, and redesign process to allow the designer to tradeoff between the risk of future redesign and the possible performance and reliability benefits. The proposed methodology represents the epistemic model uncertainty with a Kriging surrogate and is applicable in a wide range of design problems. The method is illustrated on a cantilever beam bending example and then a sounding rocket example. It is shown that redesign acts as a type of quality control measure to prevent an undesirable initial design from being accepted as the final design. It is found that the optimal design/redesign strategy for maximizing expected design performance includes not only redesign to correct an initial design that is later revealed to be unsafe, but also redesign to improve performance when an initial design is later revealed to be too conservative (e.g. too heavy).},
