awards stored as CSV files and publications stored as BibTeX file. Code depends
on vitae package. Template is combination of vitae::hyndman and
template by Steven Miller (http://svmiller.com/blog/2016/03/svm-r-markdown-cv/).

# Example
```{r}
# Job titles
job.titles <- read_csv("resume/job-titles.csv",
                      locale = locale(encoding = 'ISO-8859-1'),
                      col_types = cols(
                        begin = col_date("%m/%d/%y"),
                        end = col_date("%m/%d/%y")
                        )
)

# Job descriptions
job.descriptions <- read_csv("resume/job-descriptions.csv",
                      locale = locale(encoding = 'ISO-8859-1')
)

# Experience section
job.titles %>% 
  left_join(job.descriptions) %>% 
  vitae::detailed_entries(
    what = position,
    when = as.character(
      glue("{year(begin)} - {if_else(!is.na(end), as.character(year(end)), 'present')}")),
    with = employer,
    where = glue("{city}, {region}, {country}"),
    why = accomplishments) %>% 
  glimpse()
```
